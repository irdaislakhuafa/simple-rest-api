How to run it?
	* First
	- you have to install maven (https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
	- install MySQL for DBMS (use xampp for easier)
	- install java/jdk 1.8 and above

	* Second
	- make sure you have set the path for java/jdk
	- run mysql (I think you already know how to run mysql)
	- make sure you have installed maven and set the path so that it can be used in the terminal
	
if you have done all the requirements above correctly, type the command below to run it.
	* open your terminal
	- cd /path/to/simple-rest-api
	- mvn spring-boot:run

don't forget to git clone first haha :D
